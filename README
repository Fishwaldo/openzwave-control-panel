OZWCP is largely unmaintained, getting occasional bug fixes only. If anybody is
interested in maintaining it please let us know. There is a new OZW GUI being
developed in ozw-admin repository that should replace the functionality of
OpenZWave Control Panel.

Update 29 July 2019

Bugfix for groups, build detection macOS versus linux, can build inside or
outside of open-zwave directory

OVERVIEW

The OpenZWave Control Panel (ozwcp for short) is an application built on
the OpenZWave library https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave that permits
users to query, manage and monitor Z-Wave nodes and networks. It provides a
web based user interface using AJAX principles.

OpenZWave Control Panel was updated in 2019 to support OpenZWave 1.6
(being master branch at that time)

A feature lacking from OZW 1.6 is "Bitfields".

INSTALLATION

The web server is based on GNU's libmicrohttpd library available at

https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/

Debian based system:

apt-get install libmicrohttpd-dev

Mac using Homebrew:

brew install libmicrohttpd

If you build libmicrohttpd from source you can use the  --enable-messages
configure option for debugging.

Install Option 1 - outside of OZW folder.

First (shallow) git clone OpenZWave and build it

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave
cd open-zwave/
make

Then:

cd ..
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave-control-panel
cd open-zwave-control-panel/
make

Install Option 2 - in OZW folder

This was the only option before the 29 july 2019 update... Like option 1,
but clone the ozwcp repo in the OZW folder.

There is no need to edit the Makefile, the OS and path is detected automatically.

Currently Windows is not supported.

OPERATION

ozwcp currently runs from the command line and takes two flags:

-d for debugging
-p <portnum> port number the web server will listen on

Default port is 8090

Once started, connect to the hostname:postnum that ozwcp is running on
using a web browser and you will get to the user interface.

ozwcp currently must be run from within its distribution directory. It
serves files that must be present for it to work properly. You may need to
run it as root depending on the port number you use.

CAVEATS

This was build as a proof of concept and is "quite usable" for diagnosis and
setting stuff...

Please report bugs to the OpenZWave google groups mailing list:
